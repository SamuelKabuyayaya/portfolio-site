                    I am a student at Centennial Currently, pursuing programming, and although I am still fairly new to the field, I have already gained solid foundations in different programming languages and concepts. Programming has been my focus for the past 2 years, and I've grown comfortable with writing code and solving problems, even though I can't solve them all. Therefore, I need to get more practice and smarter to become a better programmer.
